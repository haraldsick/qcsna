# Qualitative Comparative Network Analysis with the qcsna package

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The `qcsna` package is a tool that helps you to analyze a network through qualitative comparative analysis. If you would like to know, for example, which network-based conditions (like e.g. node-level indices or node connections) are necessary and/or sufficient for a specific outcome (e.g. node attribute), this package helps you to build a bridge between descriptive social network analysis and QCA.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `qcsna` from [GitHub](https://github.com/haraldsick/qcsna) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("haraldsick/qcsna")
```
