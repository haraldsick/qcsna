Description: The qcsna package is a tool that helps you to analyze a network through qualitative comparative analysis. If you would like to know, for example, which network-based conditions (like e.g. node-level indices or node connections) are necessary and/or sufficient for a specific node attribute, this package helps you to build a bridge between descriptive social network analysis and QCA.
